Tester class accepts a number in binary, decimal, and hex which takes from the user a number in any of these three bases (binary, decimal or hex) and prints out all three representations.  If the number begins with a â€˜%â€™ assume it is binary and if it starts with a $ assume hex.  Here is an example output (user input has been underlined):
